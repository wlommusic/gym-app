Revised "Start Workout" Flow - Based on Your 3 Buttons

We'll place these three main actions prominently on your Dashboard / Home Screen.

1. On the Dashboard (Section A: Call to Action)

The "Call to Action" section will feature these three buttons prominently:

    Button 1: "Workout Template"

        Purpose: To either create a new template (initial setup for push/pull/legs, etc.) or select a specific template to start with today (if not following a strict daily rotation).

        Action:

            Tapping this takes the user to a "Template Management Screen".

            Here, they can create, edit, or select an existing template (e.g., "Push Day", "Pull Day", "Leg Day").

            If they select a template to "start now," it navigates them to the Workout Logging Screen, pre-populating it with exercises from that template, ready for logging.

    Button 2: "Resume Workout"

        Purpose: This is specifically for users who have already set up a recurring template schedule (e.g., Mon=Push, Tue=Pull). This button knows what today's workout should be based on that schedule.

        Action:

            The app checks the current date and the user's template schedule.

            It identifies which template (e.g., "Push Day") is assigned for today.

            It then navigates the user directly to the Workout Logging Screen, pre-populated with the exercises from today's assigned template.

            Crucially: If no template is assigned for today, or if no schedule is set up, this button might be disabled or prompt the user to set up a schedule/template first.

    Button 3: "Quick Start"

        Purpose: For ad-hoc workouts, or when a user doesn't want to use a template/schedule. It's for quickly adding exercises on the fly. This addresses "minimal setup but needs to be done every day."

        Action:

            Navigates directly to the Workout Logging Screen.

            The Workout Logging Screen starts completely empty.

            The user then uses an "Add Exercise" button (e.g., a FAB) to manually select exercises.

How "Quick Start" and "Workout Template" Lead to the "Workout Logging Screen"

When "Quick Start" is Tapped:

    Workout Logging Screen:

        Displays an empty list of exercises.

        Has a prominent "Add Exercise" button (e.g., a Floating Action Button at the bottom right).

        A header that says something like "New Workout - [Current Date]" or allows the user to name the workout (e.g., "Quick Session").

        User flow: Tap "Add Exercise" -> Go to Exercise List Screen (where they can filter by body part) -> Select exercise -> Return to Workout Logging Screen.

When "Workout Template" (Selected Template) or "Resume Workout" is Tapped:

    Workout Logging Screen:

        Displays the pre-populated list of exercises from the chosen/assigned template. Each exercise would be ready for sets to be logged (e.g., "Bench Press," "Overhead Press," "Tricep Pushdowns").

        A header showing the template name (e.g., "Push Day Workout").

        Still has an "Add Exercise" button (FAB) in case the user wants to add an extra exercise not in the template.

Database / Template Schedule Implications (Future Phase Consideration)

To support your "Resume Workout" button effectively, you'll eventually need:

    TEMPLATE Table: To store the definition of templates (e.g., "Push Day" template contains "Bench Press", "OHP", etc.). This would link to EXERCISE via a many-to-many relationship (a template has many exercises, an exercise can be in many templates).

    USER_TEMPLATE_SCHEDULE Table: To define what template is assigned to which day of the week for a specific user (e.g., User X: Monday=Push, Tuesday=Pull, Wednesday=Legs, Thursday=Rest...). This is what "Resume Workout" will consult.

For the immediate MVP, we can focus on the UI flow, and just assume these template structures will be available when the time comes.


 sounds good for the future i want the feature to share templates between users and load/download/share templates.

for this maybe we can store the templates in a JSON or similar format which can later be loaded in by the app.
