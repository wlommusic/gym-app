Gym Tracker App Project Summary - To Be Saved

Project Name: GymTrackerApp

Overall Goal: Develop a user-friendly Gym Tracker app, starting with a core MVP and expanding through planned phases.

Phase 1: MVP Development Goals

    Offline-First Workout Logging

    Simple Dark/Light UI with Dashboard

    Exercise Database

    Workout Logging (Sets, Reps, Weight)

Technology Stack

    Frontend Framework: React Native

    UI Library: React Native Paper (for Material Design aesthetics and components)

    Offline Database: Realm (chosen for its performance and offline-first capabilities)

    Navigation: React Navigation

    Units Handling: Store all metrics in kilograms (kg) in the database. Client-side logic will convert to pounds (lbs) for display if the user's unit_preference is set to 'lbs'.

Cardinalities:

    USER ||--o{ EXERCISE : "creates/customizes"

    USER ||--o{ WORKOUT : "performs"

    WORKOUT ||--o{ WORKOUT_EXERCISE : "contains"

    EXERCISE ||--o{ WORKOUT_EXERCISE : "used in"

    WORKOUT_EXERCISE ||--o{ SET : "has many"

UI Flow - Dashboard / Home Screen ("The Quick Glance Progress")

Core Goal: Quick access to start a workout, personalized greeting, high-level insights into recent activity/progress.

1. Top Bar / Header:

    Left: "Hello, [Username]!", "Monday, Oct 23"

    Right: Profile/Settings Icon (gear)

2. Main Content Area (Scrollable Cards):

    Section A: Call to Action (Prominent Buttons)

        "Quick Start" Button: Navigates to Workout Logging Screen (Empty). For ad-hoc workouts.

        "Workout Template" Button: Navigates to Template Management Screen (future MVP+). User can create/select templates.

        "Resume Workout" Button: (Future MVP+). App automatically loads today's scheduled template into Workout Logging Screen.

    Section B: Progress Snapshot / Streak: "ðŸ”¥ 5-Day Streak!", "ðŸ’ª 2/3 Workouts This Week", "Overall Volume: 15,000 kg"

    Section C: Last Workout Summary: Card with Workout Name, Date, Duration, Total Volume, Top Exercises. "View Details" link. Empty state message.

    Section D: Quick Access to Exercises (MVP+): "Your Exercises" card with list/grid or "View All Exercises" button.

3. Bottom Navigation Bar (Persistent):

    Home, Workouts, Exercises, Progress/Analytics (placeholder for Phase 2).

UI Flow - Workout Logging Screen (for "Quick Start" Path)

Core Goal: Efficiently add exercises and log sets/reps/weight in real-time.

1. Workout Logging Screen (Main View - Initial Empty State)

    Top Bar:

        Appbar.BackAction (Back to Dashboard, with unsaved changes prompt).

        Title: "Today's Workout - [Current Date]".

        Appbar.Action (+ icon): Navigates to "Select Body Part" Screen to add more exercises.

    Main Content: Empty state message: "Tap the '+' button to add your first exercise!"

    FAB (Bottom Right): Checkmark / "Finish" icon. Action: Finalize, save workout, navigate to Dashboard/Summary.

2. Workout Logging Screen (Main View - With Exercises Added)

    Top Bar: Same as above.

    Main Content: FlatList of Exercise Cards.

        Each card: EXERCISE.name, list of logged sets (set_number, weight_kg, reps).

        Interaction: Long-press on card to show contextual menu for "Edit Exercise Notes", "Reorder", "Delete Exercise" (from workout).

        Action: Tapping "Add Set" button within an exercise card leads to the "Log Sets" Screen for that specific exercise.

3. "Select Body Part" Screen

    Top Bar: Back button, Title: "Select Body Part", Search bar.

    Main Content: List of clickable body parts (e.g., "Chest", "Back"). Action: Tap -> "Select Exercise" Screen.

4. "Select Exercise" Screen

    Top Bar: Back button, Title: "[Selected Body Part] Exercises", Search bar, Appbar.Action (+ icon) -> "Create New Exercise" Screen/Modal.

    Main Content: List of existing exercises. Action: Tap an exercise -> Add to current workout, navigate to "Log Sets" Screen for that exercise.

5. "Create New Exercise" Screen/Modal

    Top Bar/Modal Header: Close button, Title: "Create New Exercise".

    Main Content: Input fields for Exercise Name, Primary Muscle Group (pre-filled), Type, Equipment, Description.

    Action: Save -> Create new EXERCISE in DB, add to current workout, navigate to "Log Sets" Screen for this new exercise.

6. "Log Sets" Screen

    Top Bar: Back button (to Workout Logging Screen), Title: "[Exercise Name]".

    Main Content: Displays current exercise name.

        List of already logged sets for this exercise (with Edit/Delete options for each set).

        "Add New Set" form: Input fields for weight_kg, reps. Buttons/toggles for is_warmup, is_failure, notes.

        (Optional) Rest Timer.

Future Considerations (for MVP+ / Later Phases)

    Template Management: JSON export/import strategy. Database tables for TEMPLATE and USER_TEMPLATE_SCHEDULE.

    Authentication: User login/registration flow will need to be developed, linking to the USER table.
